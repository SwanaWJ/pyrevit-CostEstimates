# ðŸ“Š pyRevit Cost Estimates Extension

Automate quantity takeoffs and cost estimation inside Autodesk Revit with **pyRevit**.  
This extension reduces manual work by directly populating costs, generating Bills of Quantities (BOQs), and calculating totals from your model.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- **Amount Population**: Automatically populate unit cost parameters (e.g., `Test_1234`) based on category.  
- **Generate BOQ**: Export structured cost breakdowns to Excel.  
- **Grand Total**: Summarize costs across all categories.  
- **Update Family Cost**: Sync family cost data using a CSV-based material pricing database.  

---
## Quick start (using the sample project)
1. Open: `assets/Sample test project.rvt`
2. In pyRevit, run: **Cost Update** â†’ **Amount** â†’ **Generate BOQ**  
   Your BOQ will be generated in three clicks.

## Update material unit costs
You can change unit prices directly from the panel:

1. **Press & hold `ALT`** and click **Cost Update** panel.  
2. Navigate to: `Multi csv` â†’ `material costs/`  
3. Edit either file:
   - `material_unit_costs.csv`
   - `material_unit_cost2.csv`
4. Save your changes and re-run **Cost Update**.

> The sample projectâ€™s families are named to match the CSVs so updates apply immediately.

## Recipes (combine materials for composite costs)
Under the **Cost** panel, open **recipes**.  
This is where you define composite items by combining materials.  
**Example (Concrete):** cement + quarry dust + crushed stones + water + labor â†’ concrete rate.

Once **recipes** and **material costs** are set, just:
1) **Cost Update** â†’ 2) **Amount** â†’ 3) **Generate BOQ** âœ…

## Roadmap: live prices (no manual updates)
Iâ€™m building a web scraper that pulls **real-time prices from hardware websites**, packages them into a JSON file, and feeds the extension automaticallyâ€”removing manual CSV updates.
